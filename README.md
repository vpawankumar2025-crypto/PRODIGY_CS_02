PRODIGY_CS_02
Advanced Image Encryption Tool
The Advanced Image Encryption Tool is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter that enables users to securely encrypt and decrypt images using a multi-layered encryption approach.

This project demonstrates how image processing, cryptography concepts, and graphical interfaces can be combined to build a secure and interactive application. The program encrypts images by applying pixel scrambling and XOR encryption, while the encryption key and permutation data are securely stored in an encrypted key file protected by a password.

The goal of this project is to provide a practical demonstration of image security, encryption techniques, and GUI development using Python.

Project Overview
Images often contain sensitive or private information. Protecting such images from unauthorized access is important in many fields including:

Secure file sharing
Digital privacy
Data protection
Confidential image storage
Research and educational demonstrations
This application allows users to encrypt images so that they appear completely unreadable, and only users with the correct key file and password can restore the original image.

The tool is designed with a simple graphical interface, making it accessible even to users with limited technical experience.

Encrypt Image button
Decrypt Image button
File selection dialogs
Password input dialogs
Success and error notification messages
The interface is designed to be easy to use while maintaining strong encryption functionality.

Encryption Architecture
The encryption system uses multiple layers of transformation to protect image data.

Pixel Scrambling
The program randomly rearranges image pixels by shuffling rows and columns using permutation arrays.

This step ensures that the image structure becomes completely distorted and visually unreadable.

Example effect:

Original Image → Structured pixels
Scrambled Image → Random pixel distribution

XOR Pixel Encryption
After scrambling, the program encrypts pixel values using a bitwise XOR operation with a randomly generated key.

XOR encryption modifies each pixel value using:

This operation ensures that pixel values cannot be interpreted without the correct key.

Password-Based Key Protection
The encryption key and permutation arrays are stored inside a key file.

Before saving, this data is encrypted using a password-derived key generated with SHA-256 hashing.

This ensures:

The key file cannot be used without the password
Attackers cannot easily retrieve encryption parameters
Sensitive encryption data remains protected
Encrypted Key File
The encrypted key file contains:

XOR encryption key
Row permutation array
Column permutation array
File format: encrypted_image.png encrypted_image.png.ekey.npy

Both files are required for successful decryption.

Decryption Workflow
Select the encrypted image file
Select the encrypted key file
Enter the password
The program decrypts the key file
The image is restored by reversing the encryption process
Steps performed internally:

XOR decryption
Pixel unscrambling
Image reconstruction
Mathematical Concepts Used
This project demonstrates several computational concepts:

Permutation algorithms
Bitwise XOR operations
Hash functions (SHA-256)
Array manipulation using NumPy
Matrix-based image representation
These techniques are widely used in cryptography, image processing, and cybersecurity systems.

Image Processing Concepts
Digital images are represented as multi-dimensional arrays.

Each pixel contains three values:

Red
Green
Blue
Encryption modifies these values to produce a secure encoded image.
